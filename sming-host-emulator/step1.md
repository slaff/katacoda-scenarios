# Source code

Let's get the latest source code from the `develop` branch. To do this just clone the repository using the following command `git clone https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming.git`{{execute}}

# Environmental variables

## SMING_HOME
We must set `SMING_HOME` to the location of the Sming Framework source code we've just downloaded. Do this by running `export SMING_HOME=$(pwd)/Sming/Sming`{{execute}}.

## SMING_ARCH
To use the Host Emulator we must set this variable to `Host`, like this: `export SMING_ARCH=Host`{{execute}}.

# Tools

## Building

## Installation

Most of the tools that are used by Sming for development can be downloaded and installed using the install.sh script, as shown below:

```
$SMING_HOME/../Tools/install.sh host
source $SMING_HOME/../Tools/export.sh
```{{execute}}

### Newer CMake
CMake 3.8 or newer is required to build LWIP, our network stack. One of the ways to install a newer version is to run the commands below:

```
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.14.4/cmake-3.14.4-Linux-x86_64.sh
sudo mkdir /opt/cmake
sudo sh cmake-3.14.4-Linux-x86_64.sh --skip-license --prefix=/opt/cmake
if [ -f /usr/bin/cmake ]; then mv /usr/bin/cmake /usr/bin/cmake.original; fi
sudo ln -s /opt/cmake/bin/cmake /usr/bin/cmake
```{{execute}}

### Newer C/C++ compiler and 32-bit libraries
Ensure you are using relatively recent compilers, with 32-bit libraries available. For Linux, you may require the gcc-multilib and g++-multilib packages to build 32-bit executables on a 64-bit OS.
To install the required packages under Ubuntu run the following commands:
```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update  -y
sudo apt-get install -y gcc-9 g++-9 gcc-9-multilib g++-9-multilib
```{{execute}}

And make sure that the newly installed GCC compiler version 9 is the default one by running the command below:
```
sudo update-alternatives \
--install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-9 60 \
--slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-9
```{{execute}}


## Analyzing

Valgrind is a tool that helps find memory issues within your application. In order to install it we need to execute the following command:
`sudo apt-get install -y valgrind libc6-dbg:i386`{{execute}}

# Setup

## Network

Before we start with our first sample we should setup special networking interfaces for our applications.
We have a script that does that for us. To see its content execute the command below:

`cat $SMING_HOME/Arch/Host/Tools/setup-network-linux.sh`{{execute}}

Now it is time to actually run the script.

`$SMING_HOME/Arch/$SMING_ARCH/Tools/setup-network-linux.sh ens3`{{execute}}

It will create a tap0 network interface for our applications and will allow our applications to access Internet.

With that we are ready with the initial setup. Time to go to the next step.
